        current time stamp
        24-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
        64-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
Files:
    timedumper.c - source code
Compiling:
    cc -Wall -o timedumper timedumper.c
Running:
    Run on the command line as "timedumper".  When you're tired of it,
    stop it with control-C.
    It takes a few options:
        -c -- color output
        -q -- try to only use about 25% of a CPU, by taking breaks
